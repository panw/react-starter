# React Babel Webpack NPM Express Starter
This a minimum setup to be used to run a React app that uses Babel, NPM, and ES6.
The system is general and can work with other frameworks or none as well - feel free to remove React specific configurations.

## Run Development Environment
0. `npm install`
1. `npm run build:dev`
2. `npm start`
3. `npm run test`

## Run Production Environment Locally
1. `npm run build:prod`
2. `npm start --production`

## Deployment
This system is agnostic of any hosting service, but there are deployment scripts for Azure Web App.

## Contributors
If this start code was helpful to you, we'd love to hear about it.
